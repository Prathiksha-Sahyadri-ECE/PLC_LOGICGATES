# 🔌 PLC-Based Basic Logic Gates Simulation

## 📘 Overview  
This is a beginner-friendly mini project where I designed and simulated *basic logic gates* like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR using a *PLC Ladder Logic Simulator*. It helped me understand how simple digital logic works in automation systems.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- PLC Ladder Logic Simulator (e.g., PLC Ladder Simulator 2 for Android)

## 👩‍💻 Responsibilities  
- Created ladder logic for each gate  
- Simulated and verified outputs  
- Understood how these gates behave in industrial control setups

## 📌 Features  
- AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR gates implemented  
- Easy to understand structure for PLC beginners  
- Useful for those starting with automation or ladder logic

## 💡 What I Learned  
- Basics of ladder logic  
- Hands-on simulation experience  
- How digital gates are used in PLC-based systems
